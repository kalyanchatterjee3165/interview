Letâ€™s say I have two lists:

Q1.
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b)
print(a is b)



Follow-Up Question:

x = None
y = None

print(x == y)
print(x is y)


Q2

Write a function that processes a given lowercase string with the following rules:
        1.        Remove all repeating characters, keeping only the first occurrence of each character.
        2.        From the resulting string, extract the first 3 unique characters.
        3.        If there are fewer than 3 characters, pad the result with underscores ('_') to make it 3 characters long.


Function Signature:

def extract_unique_three(s: str) -> str:
    pass
